## Easy
Given two arrays arr1[] and arr2[], return the merged array in ascending order containing unique elements.
Examples:
Input: arr1[] = [11, 1, 8], arr2[] = [10, 11]
Output: [1, 8, 10, 11]
Explanation: The ouput array after merging both the arrays and removing duplicates is [1, 8, 10, 11]
Input: arr1[] = [7, 1, 5, 3, 9], arr2[]  = [8, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] 
Constraints:1 ≤ arr1.size(), arr2.size() ≤ 1040 ≤ arr1[i], arr2[i] ≤ 109
